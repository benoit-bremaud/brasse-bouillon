## ✅ Step 1 – Identify Core Screens (MVP)

### Screens Selected

The following core screens have been identified as essential for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Brasse-Bouillon mobile application:

1. **Welcome / Home**
2. **Login / Signup**
3. **Dashboard**
4. **Recipe Editor (CRUD)**
5. **Brewing Session Tracker**
6. **User Profile**
7. **Favorites (Favorite Recipes)**
8. **IBU/ABV Calculator**

### Rationale for Selected Screens

These screens collectively enable the primary functionalities required for the MVP:

* **Welcome / Home:** Acts as an introductory landing page and directs users to login.
* **Login / Signup:** Facilitates secure user authentication, unlocking app features.
* **Dashboard:** Serves as the central hub for accessing recipes and brewing sessions.
* **Recipe Editor:** Core functionality for creating, editing, and deleting brewing recipes.
* **Brewing Session Tracker:** Enables users to track and document brewing processes.
* **User Profile:** Allows users to manage account details and app preferences.
* **Favorites:** Offers quick access to favorite or frequently used recipes.
* **IBU/ABV Calculator:** Provides essential brewing calculations to ensure recipe accuracy.

These screens were selected to address the fundamental needs of home brewers:

* Recipe management
* Brewing session tracking
* Technical brewing calculations
* Account and preference management

## 📋 Next Steps

The following tasks will guide the continued wireframing efforts:

1. Identify and define secondary/support screens.
2. Group all screens by user journey stages.
3. Document descriptions and key UI components for each screen.
4. Begin sketching low-fidelity wireframes in Figma.

*Note: These tasks will be completed sequentially, and progress updates will be recorded as milestones are reached.*

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Figma:** The primary tool for creating low-fidelity wireframes.

*Note: Figma templates and existing design system components will be referenced to ensure consistency throughout the design process.*
