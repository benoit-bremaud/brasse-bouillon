# Brasse-Bouillon Design Charter – Development Plan

This document defines the development structure for the Brasse-Bouillon design charter. It serves as a comprehensive roadmap for gradually building a coherent, accessible, and professional visual identity aligned with the functional and technical requirements of the mobile-first application.

Each phase (CG0 to CG6) corresponds to a dedicated milestone in the GitHub Project `brasse-bouillon · Charte Graphique`. Every section outlines the atomic tasks to be completed and the expected deliverables. This document will be regularly updated throughout the design process until final delivery.

---

## CG0 – Development Plan

* Define the roadmap structure
* Organize milestones and planning scope
* Validate the plan with the team before execution

## CG1 – Analysis & Preparation

* Define project identity pillars (values, tone, purpose)
* Identify target audience and user expectations
* Analyze competing applications and visual trends
* Gather technical constraints (multi-platform, RGPD, accessibility)
* Compile inspirational and reference materials

## CG2 – Moodboard & Art Direction

* Collect visual inspirations (color, typography, icons, layout)
* Select initial color palettes
* Explore typography pairings
* Define iconography and illustration direction
* Assemble and present a moodboard using Figma, Canva, or Miro
* Validate art direction with the team

## CG3 – Identity & Visual Elements

* Design or refine the logo (SVG/PNG formats)
* Choose primary and secondary fonts for headers, text, UI
* Define the color system (primary, secondary, success, error, info)
* Build UI component styles (buttons, inputs, alerts, tooltips)
* Define visual system rules (spacing, radius, shadows, layout)
* Save finalized assets in `/frontend/assets/` and `/docs/design`

## CG4 – Wireframes

* Define the key screens to structure (Home, Dashboard, Recipe Editor, etc.)
* Sketch low-fidelity wireframes for UX logic and layout
* Organize screens into meaningful user flows
* Validate wireframes with internal reviews or early testers

## CG5 – High-Fidelity Mockups

* Build a structured UI kit in Figma with reusable components
* Design high-fidelity mockups for all major screens
* Apply consistent styleguide and identity rules
* Prepare screen variants (e.g., dark/light mode, mobile/tablet responsiveness)
* Export mockups and assets for frontend integration

## CG6 – Documentation & Delivery

* Complete the `charte_graphique.md` file (identity, colors, fonts, rules)
* Complete the `styleguide.md` file (UI components, states, usage examples)
* Provide implementation guidelines for developers
* Review, finalize, and validate visual assets and documentation
* Version and store all deliverables in GitHub
