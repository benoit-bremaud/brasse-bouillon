# 📑 Brasse-Bouillon · Design Documentation Reference

Welcome to the **design documentation** for the Brasse-Bouillon project! This folder serves as the central hub for all design-related materials, visual assets, and deliverables.

The primary objective of this documentation is to ensure a consistent, accessible, and community-driven design foundation for the Brasse-Bouillon mobile application. Here, "community-driven" refers to contributions from both internal team members and the open-source brewing community, fostering collaboration and continuous improvement.

All design assets and documentation must remain synchronized with:

* The **Figma Design System**
* The project's **global UI design tokens**

## 📋 Documentation Guidelines

* All documentation must be written in **English**.
* Use **kebab-case** for file and folder names (e.g., `logo-primary.svg`).
* Store all large design files (Figma exports, Illustrator, PSD) inside the `/assets/` directory.
* Use Git LFS for managing large binary files if necessary.
* Each subfolder must contain a `README.md` explaining its purpose, organization, and maintenance responsibilities.
* Only finalized or validated assets and documentation should be committed.
* Prefix drafts with `wip_` or `draft_` inside `/assets` to distinguish work-in-progress files.
