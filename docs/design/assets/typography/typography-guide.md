## 📋 Usage Guidelines

* Headings (H1/H2) must always use Inter Bold.
* For body text and labels, always respect the defined sizes and line heights.
* Avoid using other font families to maintain brand consistency, which enhances both user experience and brand recognition.
* All digital products (web & mobile) must embed Inter from the provided font files to ensure uniformity and optimal text rendering.

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

### Recommended Font Formats

#### `.ttf` (TrueType Font)

* **Best for:** Mobile apps, desktop applications, and design tools.
* **Advantages:** Wide compatibility, simple local installation, ideal for app development and prototyping.
* **Disadvantages:** Larger file sizes, not optimized for website performance.

#### `.woff2` (Web Open Font Format 2)

* **Best for:** Websites and web applications.
* **Advantages:** Highly compressed for faster loading, widely supported by modern browsers, optimized for web usage.
* **Disadvantages:** Less convenient for non-web contexts, not suited for offline app usage.

### ✅ Recommended Approach

For mobile apps, desktop apps, and internal design tools, use `.ttf` files to ensure ease of development and offline compatibility.

For production websites, prefer `.woff2` formats to maximize performance, minimize loading times, and ensure compatibility across browsers.

By combining these two formats, Brasse-Bouillon ensures both smooth development workflows and optimal web performance, maintaining visual consistency and a high-quality user experience across platforms.
