# Wireframes – Brasse-Bouillon

This folder contains all low-fidelity wireframes designed for the Brasse-Bouillon mobile application. These wireframes represent the structural and functional layout of each screen before applying final visual styling.

## Purpose

Wireframes are used to:

* Explore and validate user flows
* Define screen structure and navigation
* Identify required UI elements and interactions
* Serve as a starting point for high-fidelity mockups (see `../mockups/`)

## Contents

* Static sketches in PNG or PDF format
* Annotated wireframes (optional)
* Files named by screen or feature (e.g., `login-wireframe.png`, `recipe-editor.pdf`)
* `README.md` (this file)

## Guidelines

* Keep designs simple and grayscale to focus on layout, not aesthetics
* Each file should be labeled clearly and dated if versioning is required
* Add short notes directly on the wireframes when needed

## Tools

Preferred tools: **Balsamiq**, **Figma**, **Pencil Project**, or hand-drawn digitized sketches.

## Status

✅ Final wireframes will be reviewed during milestone `CG4 – Wireframes`

Please notify the design lead when new wireframes are added or updated, and ensure they are reflected in the design charter documentation.
