## ✅ Step 1 – Identify Core Screens (MVP)

### Screens Selected

The following core screens have been identified as essential for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Brasse-Bouillon mobile application:

1. **Welcome / Home**
2. **Login / Signup**
3. **Dashboard**
4. **Recipe Editor (CRUD)**
5. **Brewing Session Tracker**
6. **User Profile**
7. **Favorites (Favorite Recipes)**
8. **IBU/ABV Calculator**

### Rationale for Selected Screens

These screens collectively enable the primary functionalities required for the MVP:

* **Welcome / Home:** Acts as an introductory landing page and directs users to login.
* **Login / Signup:** Facilitates secure user authentication, unlocking app features.
* **Dashboard:** Serves as the central hub for accessing recipes and brewing sessions.
* **Recipe Editor:** Core functionality for creating, editing, and deleting brewing recipes.
* **Brewing Session Tracker:** Enables users to track and document brewing processes.
* **User Profile:** Allows users to manage account details and app preferences.
* **Favorites:** Offers quick access to favorite or frequently used recipes.
* **IBU/ABV Calculator:** Provides essential brewing calculations to ensure recipe accuracy.

These screens were selected to address the fundamental needs of home brewers:

* Recipe management

## ✅ Step 2 – Identify Secondary/Support Screens

### Screens Selected

The following secondary and support screens have been identified to enhance user experience and provide complementary functionalities:

1. **Settings:** Preferences, language options, unit configurations, and security settings.
2. **Help / FAQ:** Guidance, tutorials, and answers to frequently asked questions.
3. **Notifications:** Important alerts and updates regarding recipes, sessions, or app status.
4. **Error Pages (404 / 500):** Screens to handle cases of missing resources or server errors.
5. **About / Legal Information:** Displays privacy policy, terms of service, and legal notices.
6. **Feedback / Contact Support:** Allows users to submit feedback or contact the support team.
7. **Changelog / Updates Log:** Lists new features, improvements, and bug fixes over time.

### Rationale for Selected Screens

These screens support the core experience by providing:

* Better user support and guidance.
* Clearer communication during errors or unexpected events.
* Legal compliance and transparency.
* Opportunities for users to engage with the development team.

They also set the foundation for smoother maintenance and iterative improvements.
