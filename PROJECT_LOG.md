### Backlog: create i18n translation issues for all French documentation

Created 9 issues (#504–#512) to systematically translate all remaining French content to English across the repository: sequence diagrams, vision, personas, requirements, user scenarios, design docs, project management, meeting notes, and mobile app UI strings. All assigned to milestone "Documentation Refactoring" except #512 (DX & Cleanup).

### Refactor: rename packages to match Discord channels (PR #502)

Renamed `packages/frontend` → `packages/mobile-app` and `packages/backend` → `packages/api`. Updated all references across CI, SonarQube config, root scripts, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and package.json workspaces. Closes #501.

### Fix: reduce Discord notification spam (PR #500)

Reduced Discord notification triggers from ~10 per action to max 3 per PR lifecycle. Removed `review_requested`, `labeled`, and comment events. Kept only `issues:opened`, `pull_request:opened`, and `pull_request:closed` (merged only). Closes #498.

### Infrastructure: import beer-label-ai into monorepo (PR #495)

Imported beer-label-ai standalone repo via `git subtree add` into `packages/beer-label-ai`. Added to npm workspaces. Created CLAUDE.md for the package. Cleaned up `_archive/` (removed 20MB act binary). All 4 standalone repos now archived on GitHub with deprecation notices.

### Fix: sync website package with standalone repo (PR #494)

Fixed `packages/website/` to match standalone repo HEAD. Fixed SyntaxError in `weekly_digest.py` (line 610: `]` → `)`). Closes #491.

### Docs: add sprint templates and design audit (PR #493)

Added sprint definition, velocity tracking templates, and design audit documentation for Scrum workflow.

### Docs: create root CLAUDE.md and rewrite README/CONTRIBUTING (PRs #401, #402)

Established cross-cutting development conventions for the monorepo in CLAUDE.md. Rewrote README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md for the new monorepo structure.

### CI/CD: create unified CI workflow (PR #398)

Created path-filtered GitHub Actions CI pipeline. Each package only runs its checks when its files change. Mobile-app: lint + typecheck + format + tests. API: lint + build + tests. Website: Python quality gate. Beer-label-ai: compile + tests.

### Infrastructure: add SonarQube configuration (PR #397)

Added `sonar-project.properties` and Makefile target for local SonarQube analysis. Configured sources, tests, coverage paths, and exclusions for TypeScript packages.

### Fix: validate packages and fix lint errors (PR #399)

Fixed ESLint and TypeScript errors across packages to ensure CI passes on the newly consolidated monorepo.

### Infrastructure: bootstrap monorepo (PR #395)

Consolidated 4 standalone repos into one monorepo using `git subtree`. Set up npm workspaces. Imported: brasse-bouillon-frontend, brasse-bouillon-backend, brasse-bouillon-website. Established root `package.json` with workspace scripts.

### Decision: monorepo consolidation strategy

Decided to consolidate all 5 standalone repos (frontend, backend, website, beer-label-ai, main) into a single monorepo using `git subtree` (preserving history). Motivation: reduce dual maintenance risk, simplify CI, unify conventions.
