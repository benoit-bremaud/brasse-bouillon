# ðŸ“‚ README â€“ Design Tokens Directory

This directory contains the **global design tokens** for the Brasse-Bouillon project.

Design tokens are standardized design variables that ensure visual consistency, scalability, and simplified maintenance throughout the project's UI components. They provide a single source of truth for key design attributes, making it easier to maintain a cohesive design system.

These tokens cover essential design properties, including:

* Typography (font families, sizes, weights)
* Borders and border radii
* Shadows and elevation effects
* Spacing (padding and margins)
* Transition durations and easing functions

They are intended for use across both **web** and **mobile** platforms to ensure a unified visual experience.

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Guidelines

* All UI components in the project must reference these tokens to maintain consistent styling.
* Developers should integrate these tokens within stylesheets, CSS-in-JS frameworks, or other design systems.
* Any updates or changes to design tokens must be documented and reflected in this directory.
* Whenever updates are made to Figma styles, corresponding updates should be applied here to maintain alignment between the design system and the codebase.

---

*Maintaining these design tokens ensures that Brasse-Bouillonâ€™s design system remains cohesive, accessible, and adaptable across all platforms.*
