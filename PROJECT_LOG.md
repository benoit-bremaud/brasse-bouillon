### CRUD + search API + dev-environment Makefile targets (#552)

Step 5 of the beer-encyclopedia epic (#541). Closes #546. Bumps
`packages/beer-encyclopedia` from v0.3.0 → **v0.4.0**.

**14 new HTTP routes** across three resources:

- `/styles` — 2 read-only routes (list, detail)
- `/breweries` — 6 routes (list + filters `country`/`city`/`brewery_type`,
  search, get, create, update, delete)
- `/beers` — 6 routes (list + filters `style_id`/`brewery_id`/`abv_min`/
  `abv_max`, search, get, create, update, delete) with FK validation at
  POST/PATCH for clean 422s instead of DB-level 500s

**Fuzzy search strategy:** on PostgreSQL, `Resource.name.op('%')(q)` in the
WHERE clause (uses the GIN trigram index from migration 001 via
`pg_trgm.similarity_threshold` gate), with `similarity()` only in
ORDER BY for ranking. On SQLite (tests), case-insensitive substring
match. Dialect detection centralized in the shared `api/db_utils.is_postgres()`.

**Slug race mitigation:** `api/slug.create_with_unique_slug()` wraps
build-then-insert in a retry loop catching `IntegrityError` (rollback, pick
a new suffix, up to 3 attempts), closing the read-then-insert race under
concurrent creates with the same display name.

**Makefile dev targets** (visible via `make help`): `setup` bootstraps
`.env` files with a fresh `JWT_SECRET` and auto-detected LAN IP (probe
order: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`/`en1` on macOS → `hostname -I` on Linux →
`localhost`), `dev-api` / `dev-mobile` / `dev` run the services with the
correct LAN URL, `test-all` also runs the beer-encyclopedia pytest suite
when a `.venv` is available, `lint-all` chains the existing npm linters.

**Tests:** 25 new behavior tests using SQLite in-memory + dependency
override on `get_db`; 64/64 passing. Ruff clean.

### Mobile harmonization: screens + yellow background (#553)

Ported Fabien's visual harmonization work on top of the monorepo mobile-app:
consistent hub/list/detail screen scaffolding, global yellow background
token, unified footer clearance across every route. Follow-up fixes
landed immediately after: P1 footer clearance on remaining screens, P2
unmatched-route wiring, nested `ImageBackground` removal to fix
horizontal overflow on scroll (`c5ca373`, `e784fc0`, `f1cb8ab`).

### API router refactor — final consolidation of #545 (#551)

Merge-follow-up on the step-4 router refactor (#545). Consolidated the
router-based architecture on main, integrating review feedback from the
2026-04-13 batch and rebasing on top of the 2026-04-12 data-model work
(#543, #544). No externally-visible behavior change vs #545; `uvicorn
api.main:app` remains the entrypoint, the lazy-engine + lifespan pattern
stands. This PR was the prerequisite for the #552 CRUD routers — they
plug into the same `api/routers/` surface.

### API refactor: router-based architecture with FastAPI lifespan (#545)

Step 4 of the beer-encyclopedia epic (#541). Restructured the FastAPI app
from inline endpoints into a router-based architecture without changing
any externally-visible behavior.

Layout (`packages/beer-encyclopedia/api/`):
- `main.py` — app factory + minimal lifespan that disposes the engine on
  shutdown (engine itself is lazy-init via `get_db()` for fast cold starts
  and easy test injection)
- `dependencies.py` — re-exports `get_db` so route handlers stay decoupled
  from `db.engine` directly
- `routers/scan.py` — hosts `/health` and `/scan` (moved verbatim from
  the original `api/main.py`)
- `schemas/scan.py` — re-exports `ScanResponse` & friends from
  `ml/schemas.py`; the indirection is in place so a future API/ML schema
  divergence touches only this module

Backward compatibility preserved: `/health` and `/scan` keep the same
paths, parameters, status codes, and response model. `uvicorn api.main:app`
remains the entrypoint.

5 new tests in `tests/test_api/test_scan.py` covering the HTTP contract
(health 200, missing file 422, non-image 400, missing content-type 400,
routes mounted at root). Total: 39/39 passing, ruff clean.

### Data models: 10-table encyclopedia schema + pg_trgm search + style seed (#544)

Step 3 of the beer-encyclopedia epic (#541). Designed and implemented the full
encyclopedia data model on top of the PostgreSQL infrastructure added in #543.

**10 ORM models** (`db/models/`): `Style`, `Brewery`, `Beer`, `Ingredient` +
`BeerIngredient` junction, `TastingProfile` (1-to-1 with Beer), `Media`
(polymorphic on beer_id/brewery_id), `Source` + `EntitySource` for
provenance tracking with JSONB raw_data (JSON fallback on SQLite),
`CommunityCorrection` for moderation queue.

**Hand-written initial migration** (`migrations/versions/001_initial_schema.py`):
all 10 tables with FK cascades (`ON DELETE CASCADE` for dependent rows,
`ON DELETE SET NULL` for `beers.brewery_id`/`style_id` so historical records
survive), CHECK constraints (ABV ranges on styles, 1–5 scales on tasting
profiles, media parent required), B-tree indexes on common filter paths
(city/country/brewery_type/FKs/abv/moderation-queue), and PostgreSQL-only
steps guarded by `_is_postgres()`: `CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm` + GIN
trigram indexes on `breweries.name` and `beers.name` for fuzzy search.

**Style seeder** (`scripts/seed_styles.py`): idempotent upsert of 15 styles
(the 8 slugs recognized by `ml/extract.py` + 7 mainstream additions:
porter, pilsner, hefeweizen, dubbel, quadrupel, barleywine, blonde ale).

**14 new tests** covering relationships, cascades, unique constraints,
check constraints, and seeder idempotence. Total: 30/30 passing on SQLite
in-memory. Ruff clean. Migration upgrade + downgrade validated on SQLite.

### Infrastructure: PostgreSQL + async SQLAlchemy + Alembic + Docker Compose (#543)

Step 2 of the beer-encyclopedia epic (#541). Added the persistence infrastructure the upcoming data models will rely on: async SQLAlchemy 2.0 engine + session factory (`db/engine.py`), ORM `Base` with `UUIDMixin` and `TimestampMixin` (`db/models/base.py`), async-aware Alembic scaffolding (`alembic.ini`, `migrations/env.py`, `migrations/script.py.mako`), and local Docker Compose stack with PostgreSQL 16 + pgAdmin (`docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`).

Switched dependency management to `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth with `[ml]` and `[dev]` optional groups; deleted the legacy `ml/requirements.txt` and updated the CI step to `pip install -e ".[ml,dev]"`. Added 6 behavior tests for the engine/session/get_db dependency (total: 16 tests passing, ruff clean).

### Epic: transform beer-label-ai into beer-encyclopedia

Kicked off a major initiative to evolve `packages/beer-label-ai` into `packages/beer-encyclopedia` — a comprehensive beer encyclopedia aiming to catalog all beers in the world. The existing ML scan pipeline becomes a sub-module feeding the encyclopedia; new capabilities include PostgreSQL persistence, multi-source data ingestion (Open Brewery DB first), community corrections, CRUD + fuzzy search API, and multi-channel consumption (mobile app + future web UI).

Created epic #541 and 6 sub-issues tracking the 6-step incremental plan: #542 rename, #543 DB infrastructure (PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy + Alembic + Docker), #544 data models (10 tables with pg_trgm search + provenance tracking), #545 API router refactor, #546 CRUD + search endpoints, #547 Open Brewery DB importer. All issues added to the Brasse-Bouillon GitHub project. New `scope:beer-encyclopedia` label created.

### Refactor: rename beer-label-ai → beer-encyclopedia

Opened PR #548 (closes #542) — purely mechanical rename via `git mv` preserving git history. Updated 11 cross-repo references: root `package.json` workspace entry, `CLAUDE.md` (structure + per-package links), `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (job name + path filter + artifact name), `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `sonar-project.properties`, plus package-level `package.json` (bumped to v0.2.0, name `@brasse-bouillon/beer-encyclopedia`), `CLAUDE.md`, and `ruff.toml`. `package-lock.json` regenerated. Existing tests (10/10) pass.
