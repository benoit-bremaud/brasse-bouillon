# ðŸ“‚ README â€“ Buttons Component Directory

This folder contains the documentation and design specifications for the **Button UI components** of the Brasse-Bouillon project.

Buttons are essential elements in the user interface. They enable users to perform actions and navigate the application efficiently. Consistent button styles are crucial to:

* Maintain visual coherence across all screens
* Clearly communicate the type and importance of actions
* Ensure accessibility and usability for all users, including those using assistive technologies

In Brasse-Bouillon, these buttons play a key role in supporting an intuitive, warm, and approachable interface, aligned with the project's handcrafted and DIY-inspired spirit.
