# üìà Button Styles Reference ‚Äì Brasse-Bouillon

This document defines the design specifications for the **Button UI components** used in the Brasse-Bouillon project.

It provides detailed visual styles, usage guidelines, and related design tokens for the four primary button types across the application. The objective is to maintain consistent appearance and behavior across web and mobile platforms.

All button styles must remain synchronized with the Brasse-Bouillon design system (e.g., Figma) and the global UI design tokens.

## üí° Best Practices

* Select the button type according to the importance of the action.
* Limit primary buttons to one per view to maintain focus and hierarchy.
* Use ghost buttons for subtle, secondary actions.
* Ensure sufficient color contrast and readability to comply with [WCAG AA accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance).
* Guarantee full keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility.
* Keep button designs aligned with the Brasse-Bouillon design system and global UI tokens.

*These button styles are integral to the Brasse-Bouillon design system and must remain consistent across all interfaces to support usability, accessibility, and cohesive design.*
