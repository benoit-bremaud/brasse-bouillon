# 📑 Brasse-Bouillon · Design Documentation Reference

Welcome to the **design documentation** for the Brasse-Bouillon project! This folder serves as the central hub for all design-related materials, visual assets, and deliverables.

The primary objective of this documentation is to ensure a consistent, accessible, and community-driven design foundation for the Brasse-Bouillon mobile application. Here, "community-driven" refers to contributions from both internal team members and the open-source brewing community, fostering collaboration and continuous improvement.

All design assets and documentation must remain synchronized with:

* The **Figma Design System**
* The project's **global UI design tokens**

## 📋 Documentation Guidelines

* All documentation must be written in **English**.
* Use **kebab-case** for file and folder names (e.g., `logo-primary.svg`).
* Store all large design files (Figma exports, Illustrator, PSD) inside the `/assets/` directory.
* **PNG size policy** — every PNG committed under `docs/design/` must stay under **2 MB**. This keeps Claude Code / AI-agent API requests below the 32 MB per-request limit. Before committing a new PNG, run the compression helper from the repo root:

  ```bash
  python3 tools/compress-design-pngs.py docs/design
  ```

  The script walks the folder, quantizes each PNG to a 256-color adaptive palette, and rewrites in place. Quality loss is acceptable for moodboard and reference material. For the rare case where preserving full fidelity matters (logo export, print-ready asset), keep the source file outside the repo and commit a compressed preview.
* Each subfolder must contain a `README.md` explaining its purpose, organization, and maintenance responsibilities.
* Only finalized or validated assets and documentation should be committed.
* Prefix drafts with `wip_` or `draft_` inside `/assets` to distinguish work-in-progress files.

## 🚀 Design Workflow

This documentation supports a structured and iterative design process:

1. Define target audience and personas. Update regularly to reflect evolving user needs.
2. Gather visual inspiration and create moodboards.
3. Establish a consistent style guide, including colors, typography, and UI components.
4. Design wireframes to test user flows and layouts, using approved design tools and testing methods.
5. Develop high-fidelity mockups.
6. Consolidate design rules and decisions within the design charter.
7. Document technical, platform, and accessibility constraints.
8. Analyze competitor products and market trends.

## 📢 Contribution Process

To contribute updates or new design materials:

1. Notify the design team in advance.
2. Validate assets with the design lead before committing.
3. Clearly document all additions in the relevant `README.md`.
4. Ensure all materials comply with the style guide and design charter.
