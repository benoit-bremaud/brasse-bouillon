# Mockups – Brasse-Bouillon

This folder contains all high-fidelity screen mockups for the Brasse-Bouillon mobile application. These mockups reflect the final visual style defined by the design charter and are intended to guide frontend development.

## Contents

* Visual compositions of main screens (e.g., Home, Dashboard, Recipe Editor)
* Variants for different states or modes (e.g., dark mode, onboarding, error states)
* Previews exported in PNG format
* Source files (e.g., Figma, Sketch) when applicable

## Guidelines

* All mockups should conform to the styleguide defined in `../styleguide.md`
* Screens must be labeled clearly (e.g., `home-light.png`, `recipe-edit-dark.png`)
* Changes should be versioned and committed with context in pull requests

## Tools

Preferred tools: **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Adobe XD**.

If mockups are designed in Figma, include a public link or export the `.fig` file if possible.

## Status

✅ Final mockups will be validated during milestone `CG5 – High-Fidelity Mockups`
