## 📌 Documentation Guidelines

* Store all **.fig / .psd / .ai** or large design source files inside the `assets/` directory. Use Git LFS to manage large binaries when appropriate.
* Each subfolder must contain a `README.md` outlining its purpose, organization, and content.
* All documentation must be written in **English**, and file names must follow the **kebab-case** naming convention (e.g., `logo-primary.svg`).
* Only finalized or approved materials should be committed. Work-in-progress drafts must be saved under `/assets` using a prefix such as `wip_` or `draft_`.

## 🚀 Design Workflow

This documentation supports a structured and iterative design process:

1. Define user personas and capture target needs.
2. Collect visual inspiration and assemble moodboards.
3. Establish a unified styleguide with a consistent color palette, typography, and UI components.
4. Build wireframes to test layout and navigation logic.
5. Design and refine high-fidelity mockups.
6. Consolidate design rules and assets into a formal design charter.
7. Document all technical, platform, and accessibility constraints.
8. Perform competitive and UX trend analysis.
