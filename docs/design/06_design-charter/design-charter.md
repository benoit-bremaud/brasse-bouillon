## 9. Visual System

This section defines the foundational visual system rules for the Brasse-Bouillon Design System, ensuring layout consistency and harmonious visual rhythm across all screens.

### 1. Grid System

The grid system defines the structural layout framework for Brasse-Bouillon, following a mobile-first approach to ensure accessibility and simplicity.

#### Grid Specifications (Mobile)

* **Number of Columns:** 4
* **Gutter (Spacing Between Columns):** 16px
* **Outer Margins (Horizontal Padding):** 16px on both sides

#### Rationale

This 4-column grid allows flexible and straightforward layouts on small screens while maintaining sufficient breathing space. The 16px gutter and outer margins ensure a balanced and consistent visual rhythm.

#### Note

This grid system can be expanded for larger screens (e.g., tablets, desktops) by increasing the number of columns (e.g., 8 or 12) and adjusting gutters and margins accordingly.

### 2. Spacing Scale

The spacing scale defines standardized spacing increments for margins and paddings, ensuring consistent vertical and horizontal rhythm across the interface.

#### Spacing Tokens

| Token        | Value (px) | Recommended Usage                         |
|--------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| `spacing-xxs`| 4px        | Minimal gaps (e.g., between icons and text)|
| `spacing-xs` | 8px        | Small gaps for tight spaces               |
| `spacing-sm` | 12px       | Small paddings or margins for compact UI elements |
| `spacing-md` | 16px       | Default spacing for most mobile layouts   |
| `spacing-lg` | 24px       | Section spacing on mobile                 |
| `spacing-xl` | 32px       | Large gaps (e.g., section separators)     |
| `spacing-xxl`| 40px       | Very large gaps, primarily for large screens or feature sections |

#### Note

This scale is designed to support mobile-first layouts but scales effectively for larger screens if needed. All components should adhere to this system to maintain a unified appearance.

### 3. Corner Radii

Corner radii establish the standard levels of border roundness applied to UI components, ensuring visual consistency throughout the Brasse-Bouillon application.

#### Radius Tokens

| Token         | Value (px) | Recommended Usage                                    |
|---------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `radius-xs`   | 4px        | Small elements such as badges or small icon containers |
| `radius-sm`   | 8px        | Default for buttons, input fields, and modal corners   |
| `radius-md`   | 12px       | Used for cards, larger containers, or main sections    |
| `radius-full` | 9999px     | Fully circular shapes (e.g., avatars, round buttons)   |

#### Note

All UI components should follow these standardized corner radii to maintain a cohesive design language across screens and devices.

### 4. Shadow Styles

Shadow styles define the depth and elevation of UI components, helping to establish visual hierarchy and improve focus on interactive elements.

#### Shadow Tokens

| Token       | CSS Value                                  | Recommended Usage                          |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `shadow-sm` | 0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)            | Light shadows for subtle elements like buttons or small containers |
| `shadow-md` | 0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)            | Medium elevation for cards or floating panels |
| `shadow-lg` | 0px 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)          | Large elevation for modals, overlays, or important UI layers |

#### Note

Use these shadow styles consistently to ensure a balanced visual hierarchy across the application. Avoid adding custom shadow styles outside of these defined levels.
